    "Chi-square (χ²) is a statistical test and a probability distribution used in hypothesis testing and data analysis, particularly in the field of statistics. It is employed to determine if there is a significant association or relationship between two categorical variables in a dataset. The chi-square test is used to evaluate whether the observed distribution of data significantly differs from the expected distribution under a specific hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common types of chi-square tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chi-square goodness-of-fit test**: This test is used when you want to determine if an observed categorical distribution fits an expected theoretical distribution. It answers questions like, \"Does the observed data fit the expected proportions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chi-square test of independence**: This test is used to assess if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It helps answer questions like, \"Are these two categorical variables independent of each other or related?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of how each test works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chi-square goodness-of-fit test**: In this test, you have one categorical variable, and you compare the observed frequencies (counts) of each category to the expected frequencies that you would expect if a particular hypothesis were true. The chi-square statistic quantifies how much the observed frequencies deviate from the expected frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chi-square test of independence**: In this test, you have two categorical variables, and you want to determine if they are related or independent of each other. You create a contingency table that shows the joint distribution of the two variables, and then you calculate the chi-square statistic to test whether the observed frequencies in the table differ significantly from what would be expected if the variables were independent.\n",
